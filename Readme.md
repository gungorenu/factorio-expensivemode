# Expensive Mode

This is a mod to make *Expensive Mode* recipes set on normal in vanilla.

No change on recipes are intended, **if there is then it is a bug.**

**Reason:**  [this](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=104026) thread hints devs have agreed (! maybe not but that is my understanding !) to remove expensive mode, and it is really going to happen so mods relying on expensive mode (some of my mods) shall fail and requires redesign. to evade work later I put this mod here to mimic Expensive Mode. 

*Optional*, there is a flag to enable the entire mod changes, or revert back simply. basically it disables the mod, not sure how it would be useful but for now added for experimenting

There shall be a setting to check if this mod is enabled or not. **ugung-expensivemode-enabled** is a boolean value. if set then it means expensive mode is active.
